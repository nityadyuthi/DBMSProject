Also, you will have to create an account on [RemoteMySQL](http://remotemysql.com) or any other SQL Service and **add the profile info in the database connection in app.js**

## Usage
This project is a(n extremely simple) full stack web application to access a database.

The database is hosted for free at [RemoteMySQL](http://remotemysql.com) and administered using phpMyAdmin.

Note: Auth is as basic as it could be, it can be improved. Also, make sure to give a stronger password for the **very secret** username, and make sure to make it an environment var.

If you need to use this project, please make sure to add proper authentication.
